Home Credit Default Risk Recognition 
---------------------------------------

An important fraction of the population finds it difficult to get their home loans approved due to insufficient or absent credit history. This prevents them to buy their own dream homes and at times even forces them to rely on other sources of money which may be unreliable and have exorbitant interest rates. Conversely, it is a major challenge for banks and other finance lending agencies to decide for which candidates to approve housing loans. The credit history is not always a sufficient tool for decisions, since it is possible that those borrowers with a long credit history can still default on the loan and some people with a good chance of loan repayment may simply not have a sufficiently long credit history.

A number of recent researchers have applied machine learning to predict the loan default risk. This is important since a machine learning-based classification tool to predict the loan default risk which uses more features than just the traditional credit history can be of great help for both, potential borrowers, and the lending institutions.

 Problem Statement

The problem and associated data has been provided by Home Call Credit Group for a Kaggle competition. The problem can be described as, “A binary classification problem where the inputs are various features describing the financial and behavioral history of the loan applicants, in order to predict whether the loan will be repaid or defaulted.” 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The objective of this competition is to use historical loan application data to predict whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan. This is a standard supervised classification task:

Supervised: The labels are included in the training data and the goal is to train a model to learn to predict the labels from the features.

Classification: The label is a binary variable, 0 (will repay loan on time), 1 (will have difficulty repaying loan)
